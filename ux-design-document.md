# Restaurant Content Calendar - UX Design Document

## Executive Summary

This UX design document outlines the user experience strategy for a modern restaurant content calendar application built with Next.js, shadcn/ui, and a black/white/grayscale aesthetic. The design focuses on intuitive navigation, smooth state transitions, and responsive behavior across devices while maintaining professional visual hierarchy.

## 1. Design Principles

### Core Design Philosophy
- **Minimalist Elegance**: Clean, uncluttered interface using grayscale palette
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed contextually to avoid overwhelming users
- **Consistent Interaction**: Predictable patterns across all interface elements
- **Accessibility First**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support throughout
- **Performance Focused**: Smooth transitions and optimized loading states

### Visual Design Principles
- **Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture using typography, spacing, and subtle shadows
- **Contrast**: Strategic use of grayscale tones for functional differentiation
- **Consistency**: Uniform spacing, border radius, and interactive states
- **Feedback**: Immediate visual response to all user actions

## 2. User Journey Mapping

### Primary User Flow: Content Generation Process

```
Empty State → Loading State → Content Views → Content Management
     ↓             ↓              ↓               ↓
   Entry         Processing    Navigation      Interaction
   Point         Feedback      Experience      & Updates
```

#### Phase 1: Entry Point (Empty State)
**User Goal**: Understand the application purpose and initiate content generation
**Duration**: 5-15 seconds

**Experience Design**:

- Supportive copy explaining the AI generation process
- Subtle animations on button hover for engagement

**Key Elements**:
- Hero headline: "Create Your Social Media Calendar"
- Descriptive text explaining AI capabilities
- Gradient "Generate Content" button with hover effects
- Clean white background with subtle shadows

#### Phase 2: Processing (Loading State)
**User Goal**: Understand progress and maintain engagement during generation
**Duration**: 2-3 seconds

**Experience Design**:

- Consistent card structure matching final content
- Subtle fade transitions between states

#### Phase 3: Navigation Experience (Content Views)
**User Goal**: Efficiently browse and understand generated content across different views
**Duration**: Ongoing primary interaction

**Experience Design**:
- Header appears with smooth fade-in animation
- Tab-based view switching with clear visual states
- Each view optimized for its specific use case
- Breadcrumb understanding of current location

**Key Elements**:
- View control tabs with icons and labels
- Active state highlighting
- Smooth transitions between view modes
- Consistent content regardless of view

#### Phase 4: Content Interaction
**User Goal**: Review, organize, and manage social media content
**Duration**: Extended engagement sessions

**Experience Design**:
- Hover states providing additional information
- Click interactions for detailed views
- Drag-and-drop for kanban organization
- Status indicators and metadata display

## 3. View-Specific UX Design

### 3.1 Grid View - Content Discovery
**Primary Use Case**: Overview and content browsing

**Layout Strategy**:
- Responsive CSS Grid (300px minimum column width)
- Masonry-style layout preventing awkward gaps
- 20px consistent spacing between cards
- Hover elevation for depth perception

**Interaction Patterns**:
- Subtle card lift on hover (5px transform)
- Shadow intensification for depth
- Image lazy loading for performance
- Click-to-expand for detailed view

**Card Design**:
- Image at top (180px height, object-fit: cover)
- Content padding: 20px uniform
- Date badge in brand blue (#007bff)
- Text hierarchy: Date → Content → Hashtags
- Rounded corners (12px) for modern feel

### 3.2 Calendar View - Timeline Visualization
**Primary Use Case**: Scheduling and temporal planning

**Layout Strategy**:
- Traditional monthly calendar grid
- 7-column layout for days of week
- 120px row height for adequate content space
- Header with day abbreviations

**Interaction Patterns**:
- Day cells with hover states
- Post indicators as clickable pills
- Month navigation (future enhancement)
- Day-specific content overlay

**Visual Elements**:
- Clean grid lines (1px #e9ecef)
- Post pills in light blue (#e9f5ff)
- Day numbers in top-left corner
- Text truncation with ellipsis

### 3.3 Kanban View - Status Management  
**Primary Use Case**: Workflow management and status tracking

**Layout Strategy**:
- Three-column flex layout
- Equal width distribution
- Vertical scrolling within columns
- Clear column headers with counts

**Interaction Patterns**:
- Drag-and-drop between columns (future)
- Compact card design without images
- Status-specific color coding
- Column-specific hover states

**Column Design**:
- Background: Light gray (#f1f3f5)
- Headers with post counts
- 15px padding for comfortable spacing
- Rounded corners for modern appearance

## 4. Responsive Design Strategy

### Mobile-First Approach
**Breakpoints**:
- Mobile: 320px - 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px  
- Desktop: 1024px+

### Mobile Adaptations

#### Sidebar Navigation
- Transform to slide-out drawer on mobile
- Hamburger menu icon in header
- Overlay approach for content access
- Touch-optimized tap targets (44px minimum)

#### Content Views
- **Grid**: Single column layout
- **Calendar**: Compressed monthly view with scroll
- **Kanban**: Horizontal scroll or stacked columns

#### Touch Interactions
- Increased tap targets for mobile
- Swipe gestures for view navigation
- Pull-to-refresh for content updates
- Touch-friendly drag operations

### Tablet Considerations
- Sidebar remains visible but condensed
- Grid view: 2-3 columns depending on orientation
- Calendar maintains full structure
- Touch and mouse interaction hybrid support

## 5. Loading States and Transitions

### Animation Strategy
**Principles**:
- Subtle and purposeful animations
- Consistent timing (0.2s for interactions, 0.5s for state changes)
- Easing functions for natural movement
- Respect user preferences for reduced motion

### Transition Types

#### State Transitions
```css
.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-out;
}

.slide-up {
  animation: slideUp 0.3s ease-out;
}

.shimmer {
  animation: shimmer 1.5s infinite;
}
```

#### Loading Sequences
1. **Empty → Loading**: Fade out empty state, fade in skeleton
2. **Loading → Content**: Fade out skeleton, staggered card appearance
3. **View Switching**: Cross-fade with slight vertical offset

### Performance Considerations
- CSS transforms over position changes
- Will-change property for animated elements
- GPU acceleration for smooth transitions
- Debounced interactions to prevent jank

## 6. Interaction Patterns and Micro-interactions

### Button Interactions
**Primary Buttons**:
- Gradient background with shadow
- Hover: Slight elevation (-2px transform)
- Active: Pressed state with reduced shadow
- Focus: Visible outline for accessibility

**Secondary Buttons**:
- Border-only design in default state
- Hover: Background fill transition
- Consistent with overall gray palette

### Card Interactions
**Hover States**:
- Elevation increase (box-shadow intensification)
- Subtle transform (translateY(-5px))
- Border color shifts for definition
- Cursor pointer for clickable indication

**Selection States**:
- Border highlight in brand color
- Subtle background tint
- Checkbox or selection indicator

### Form Elements
**Input Fields**:
- Clean border design with focus states
- Label animation on focus/blur
- Error states with red accent
- Success states with green accent

## 7. Accessibility Guidelines
